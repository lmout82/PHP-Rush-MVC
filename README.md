# Rush PHP-MVC

During my intensive training course at "Coding Academy" (Epitech-Paris, France), I had to realize several "rush" projects as a way to assess my knowledge at the end of each module.

Here is one project from a PHP-MVC rush (4 days), realized as a pair. I was especially in charge of the server-side scripting (PHP5/MySQL).
